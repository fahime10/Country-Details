# Country-Details
## What the app does
The app uses SOAP calls to gather information of countries, such as flag, currency and their capital.
Firstly, a SOAP call is used to extract all the countries that the web service has stored, then provide a drop down with all those countries and their codes.
There are three options. The user can choose the full information to view all the details, they can choose just the capital to pin point a single result or they can
choose currency to pin point just the currency name of that country.
The web service provides all kinds of details, but in this app, the functions used are for simple practice.
